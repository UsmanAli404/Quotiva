# Quotiva
This is a command line interface based program that shows random uplifting and deep quotes stored in the text files provided.
It has a user signup and login functionality as well as admin login functionality.
The program also keeps track of user data to show some interesting stats.
Have fun tinkering with it.
I would really appreciate if you contact me to collaborate on making a GUI for it as well as for making any improvements or giving general suggestions.
Have a nice day coding!
